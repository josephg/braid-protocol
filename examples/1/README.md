This first example shows how you can use this library to subscribe to a simple feed of values which change over time. This feed makes no use of versions or patches.

To run this example, first run `yarn` from the root directory of this repository. Then in one terminal run:

```
$ node server.js
```

And in another terminal run:

```
$ node client.js
```
